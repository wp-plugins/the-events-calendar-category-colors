Add background colors to month event view of The Events Calendar events.

== Description ==

Add background colors to event categories displayed in the month event view of The Events Calendar. This is inspired by [Coloring Your Category Events](http://tri.be/coloring-your-category-events).

Settings for The Events Calendar Category Colors plugin are located in their own tab on The Events Calendar Settings page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `/the-events-calendar-category-colors/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Go to the Category Colors tab of The Event Calendar Settings page.

To include a Category Color legend above your calendar you will need to place a copy of `ecp-page-template.php` in your theme's **events** directory, similar to `my-theme/events/ecp-page-template.php`. This file is found in The Events Calendar plugin's **views** directory. Please refer to <a href="http://tri.be/themers-guide-to-the-events-calendar/">Themer's Guide for The Events Calendar</a> for reference.

Within your copy of `ecp-page-template.php` you will need to insert `<?php teccc_legend_hook(); ?>` where you want the legend to appear.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin require The Events Calendar plugin? =

Yes. [The Events Calendar plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/the-events-calendar/) is written by Modern Tribe, Inc. It requires at least The Events Calendar v2.0.5.

= My calendar is taking on the styling of my first event of the month =

There are two things you can try.

1. With help from Barry Hughes, I've adapted a function that will remove the category class tag that appears in the article tag on that page. Usually this is when the **Default Page Template** is selected in the Events Calendar Settings. Simply <a href="https://gist.github.com/4324054">add the code in this gist</a> to your theme's _functions.php_ file. If it causes problems, and it may, just remove the code and try #2.

2. Using <a href="http://tri.be/support/documentation/events-calendar-themers-guide/">Themer's Guide for The Events Calendar</a> create a new _ecp-page-template.php_, adjust this new template to correspond to how you want your calendar displayed and choose **Default Events Template** from the Events Calendar Settings.

= What are Legend Superpowers? =

Legend Superpowers are an optional visual effect allowing visitors to focus only on those events that belong to categories of interest - without reloading the page and without eliminating other categories from view completely.

It needs to be enabled in the Category Colors settings page. The Category Legend must also be enabled and in use for it to function.

Click on the category of interest in the Legend to see the effect; click again to remove it.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Add a new topic on the [WordPress Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/the-events-calendar-category-colors).
