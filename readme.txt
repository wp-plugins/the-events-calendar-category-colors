Add background colors to month event view of The Events Calendar events.

== Description ==

Add background colors to event categories displayed in the month event view of The Events Calendar. This is inspired by [Coloring Your Category Events](http://tri.be/coloring-your-category-events).

Settings for The Events Calendar Category Colors plugin are located in their own tab on The Events Calendar Settings page. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `/the-events-calendar-category-colors/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Go to the Category Colors tab of The Event Calendar Settings page.

To include a Category Color legend above your calendar you will need to place a copy of `ecp-page-template.php` in your theme's **events** directory, similar to `my-theme/events/ecp-page-template.php`. This file is found in The Events Calendar plugin's **views** directory. Please refer to <a href="http://tri.be/themers-guide-to-the-events-calendar/">Themer's Guide for The Events Calendar</a> for reference.

Within your copy of `ecp-page-template.php` you will need to insert `<?php teccc_legend_hook(); ?>` where you want the legend to appear.
